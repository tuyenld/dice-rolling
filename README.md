# Dice-rolling using Python

Hey there, 

I am going to create a dice-rolling program using python. The code you create will be stored in the `app.py` file. This repo also contains course materials under the issues tab. Microsoft Azure "App Service" is using to deploy the app.

Note:
- By [default](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python?tabs=bash&pivots=python-framework-flask), the **App Service Azure** server assumes that the app's entry module is in `app.py`, as used in the sample.
